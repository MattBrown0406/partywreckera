  {
    question: "Can you do an intervention without a professional interventionist?",
    answer:
      "Yes, in some situations. A unified family with no history of violence, no serious co-occurring mental illness, treatment already arranged, and no previous failed attempts can hold an effective family-led intervention. If any of those conditions are missing, professional help significantly improves the odds.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the success rate of a family-led intervention?",
    answer:
      "There's no reliable statistic, because informal interventions are never documented. What professional work shows is that preparation and family unity are the strongest predictors of someone accepting help — both of which families can build, with or without a professional.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should you not do during an intervention?",
    answer:
      "Don't improvise, don't argue, and don't negotiate the plan in the room. Avoid shaming language, old grievances, and ultimatums you don't intend to keep. An intervention is an offer of help with clear boundaries — not a trial.",
  },
  {
    question: "When should a family hire a professional interventionist?",
    answer:
      "When the family is divided, when previous attempts have failed, when there's a history of violence or self-harm, when mental illness is involved, or when the stakes are too high to risk a failed attempt. Family dynamics matter more than the severity of the addiction.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the person says no during an intervention?",
    answer:
      "A \u201cno\u201d isn't the end — it's the beginning of the boundaries phase. The family follows through on the changes they described, and many people accept help days or weeks later once those boundaries hold.",
  },

          <p>
            A few weeks ago, on a first phone call, a mother asked me the question most families think but never say out loud: "Be honest with me, Matt. Do we actually need you? Or can we just do this ourselves?"
          </p>

          <p>
            I laughed, because it took nerve to ask the guy who does interventions for a living whether his job is necessary. Then I gave her the honest answer — the same one I'm giving you here, because I'd rather tell you the truth than protect my invoice.
          </p>

          <p>
            So: can you do an intervention without a professional? Sometimes, yes. Sometimes it's the worst idea in the world. The difference isn't how much you love the person. It's a handful of specific factors most families never think to check.
          </p>

          <h2>Can a Family Do an Intervention Without a Professional?</h2>

          <p>
            The short answer: yes, families can hold an intervention without a professional, and sometimes it works. A calm, unified family with a clear plan, treatment already arranged, and no history of volatility can have that conversation on their own. Plenty of people are alive today because their family sat them down at a kitchen table with no interventionist in sight.
          </p>

          <p>
            But here's the part that matters. The conversation is maybe twenty percent of what I actually do. The other eighty percent is everything around it — preparation, logistics, family work, and managing what happens when things don't go according to script. Which, in my experience, is most of the time.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I got sober twenty-three years ago, I was on the receiving end of hard conversations from people who loved me. It wasn't the words that reached me. It was the structure around the words. Whoever holds that structure, the structure is the thing.
          </p>

          <h2>When a DIY Intervention Can Work</h2>

          <p>
            A do-it-yourself intervention has a real shot when specific conditions line up. Before you gather everyone in the living room, check your situation against this list honestly:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Everyone in the family is on the same page.</strong> Not mostly. Actually. One person who breaks ranks mid-conversation can unravel the whole thing in thirty seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>There's no history of violence, threats, or self-harm.</strong> If confrontation has ever turned dangerous in your family, do not run this play without help.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>It's substances alone</strong> — not substances plus serious untreated mental illness. Addiction layered with psychosis, suicidality, or severe trauma changes the entire equation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Treatment is already arranged.</strong> A bed, a date, a ride. "We'll figure it out if he says yes" is how a yes turns back into a no by Thursday.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>This is your first structured attempt.</strong> If you've already tried and it blew up, the next attempt gets harder. Your loved one has seen your cards.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you can honestly check every box, a family-led conversation might be exactly right. I'm not in the business of convincing families they're helpless. Most families are far more capable than they believe — they're just exhausted.
          </p>

          <h2>When You Need a Professional Interventionist</h2>

          <p>
            The honest flip side: some situations call for a professional, and pretending otherwise costs families months or years. These are the situations where I tell families not to go it alone:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The family is divided.</strong> Mom wants treatment, Dad thinks it's overblown, the siblings stopped talking about it years ago. A divided family doesn't need a meeting — it needs a mediator first.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>There have been previous failed attempts.</strong> Every failed intervention teaches your loved one they can outlast you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Addiction is tangled up with mental health.</strong> Co-occurring conditions require someone who knows which treatment settings can actually handle them — and which ones just say they can.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Someone in the room can't hold the line.</strong> A parent who folds, a spouse who rescues, a sibling who explodes. You already know who it is. The addiction knows too.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The stakes are immediate.</strong> Overdose history, drunk driving with kids in the car, legal deadlines. When there's no room for a second attempt, the first one has to count.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Notice what's not on that list: how bad the addiction is. Severity matters less than family dynamics. I've seen unified families reach a late-stage alcoholic at a kitchen table, and chaotic families fail to reach someone a year into trouble. If you're weighing that call, our guide on{" "}

            </Link>{" "}
            walks through what to look for.
          </p>

          <h2>What Does a Professional Actually Change?</h2>

          <p>
            A professional doesn't bring magic words. Nobody has ever gotten sober because of a perfectly crafted sentence. What a professional changes is the structure and the temperature of the room.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm the one person present with no history. Your loved one can't pull me into an old argument, can't remind me of what I did in 1998, can't find my guilt button — I don't have one installed. That neutrality lets the family speak from love while someone else holds the boundaries.
          </p>

          <p>
            The rest is preparation. Before I ever meet your loved one, I've spent hours with the family: mapping the dynamics, rehearsing the hard moments, deciding in advance what happens if the answer is no. Families doing this alone usually spend all their energy planning what to say and none planning what to do when the plan meets reality. Many of the{" "}

            </Link>{" "}
            trace back to exactly that gap.
          </p>

          <h2>If You're Going to Do It Yourselves, Do It Right</h2>

          <p>If your situation checks the boxes, don't wing it. Give yourselves the same structure I'd give you:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Meet without your loved one first</strong> — at least twice. Get everyone aligned on the message, the ask, and the boundaries.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Arrange treatment before the conversation.</strong> Admission ready, transportation planned, same day.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Write down what you'll say.</strong> Speaking from the heart sounds nice; speaking from a letter keeps you from speaking from anger.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Decide your "no" plan in advance.</strong> What changes if they refuse? If the answer is nothing, you're not ready yet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pick one calm person to lead.</strong> Emotions will surge; someone has to keep the room on track.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            One more thing: bringing in help partway through isn't failure. Some of the best outcomes I've been part of started with a family who tried it themselves, learned where the walls were, and then called. That first attempt wasn't wasted. It was reconnaissance.
          </p>

          <h2>The Question Behind the Question</h2>

          <p>
            When that mother asked if she really needed a professional, I think she was actually asking: "Is it okay that we can't fix this by ourselves?"
          </p>

          <p>
            You were never supposed to fix this by yourselves. Addiction is a family illness that convinces every family it's a private problem. Whether your next step is a kitchen-table conversation or a phone call to someone like me, the step that matters is the one out of isolation.
          </p>

          <p>You don't have to get it perfect. You just have to stop doing it alone.</p>
