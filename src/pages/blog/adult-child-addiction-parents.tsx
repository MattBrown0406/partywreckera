    question: "Can I force my adult child into rehab?",
    answer:
      "Generally, no. A few states have involuntary commitment laws for substance use, but they're limited and vary widely. In practice, structured leverage — what you fund, where they live, and a professionally guided intervention — moves adults into treatment far more often than legal force does.",
  },
  {
    question: "Am I enabling my adult child if I let them live at home?",
    answer:
      "Not automatically. Housing tied to clear conditions — treatment, sobriety, contribution — can support recovery. Housing with no conditions while active addiction continues usually just makes the addiction more comfortable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I keep giving my adult child money?",
    answer:
      "Not cash, and not during active addiction. If you want to help financially, pay for treatment, assessment, or recovery housing directly. Fund the solution, never the lifestyle.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my adult child gets angry when I set boundaries?",
    answer:
      "Expect it. Anger is usually the addiction negotiating, not your child rejecting you. Stay calm, repeat your message, and don't bargain. Anger that meets consistency tends to burn out. Anger that meets guilt gets stronger.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it ever too late for an adult child to recover?",
    answer:
      "No. People get sober at 50, 60, and beyond. Age changes the logistics of recovery, not the possibility of it. The better question isn't whether it's too late for them — it's whether you're ready to change your part now.",

        <article className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-foreground/90 space-y-6">
          <p>
            Most weeks, the first phone call I get isn't from a wife or a sibling. It's from a mother in her sixties, calling about her son. He's 38. He has a college degree, a storage unit full of unfinished plans, and a bedroom in her house that was supposed to be a guest room. She starts the call by apologizing for bothering me.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know that call from both sides. Twenty-three years ago, I was the adult child. My family loved me through years of chaos before they figured out that loving me and funding my addiction were two different things. Adult child addiction puts parents in one of the hardest positions a family can occupy — all of the love, almost none of the leverage. This article is about what you can actually do from that position.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-10">Why Is Adult Child Addiction So Hard on Parents?</h2>

          <p>
            It's hard because your parenting instincts and your legal reality point in opposite directions. You're wired to rescue your child, but you can't make medical, financial, or legal decisions for another adult. When they were ten, you could take them to the doctor. At 38, you can only watch — or so it feels.
          </p>

          <p>
            Parents tell me the same things on almost every call. "I can't just let him be homeless." "She's still my baby." "If something happens, I'll never forgive myself." None of that is wrong. It's love doing exactly what love does.
          </p>

          <p>
            But here's what happens quietly underneath: the helplessness gets converted into obligation. If I can't make him stop, at least I can keep him alive. And that sentence slowly becomes the family budget. The rent. The phone. The car insurance. The lawyer. I have yet to meet a parent who dreamed of retiring so they could fund a 40-year-old's phone plan, but I meet plenty who are doing it.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-10">Are You Helping Your Adult Child or Funding the Addiction?</h2>

          <p>
            Here's the cleanest test I know: if your support makes the consequences of drinking or using softer, it's probably enabling. Help moves a person toward treatment and responsibility. Enabling makes active addiction more comfortable to live in.
          </p>

          <p>Take an honest inventory. Not a guilty one — an honest one:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Are you paying rent on an apartment they're using drugs in?</li>
            <li>Are you covering the phone, the car, the insurance — the infrastructure of their daily life?</li>
            <li>Have you paid bail, court fees, or attorney bills more than once?</li>
            <li>Do you give "grocery money" in cash and try not to think about where it goes?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Every dollar that absorbs a consequence delays the moment reality gets loud enough to matter. I watched this from the inside. The turning point in my own story wasn't when my family got angrier. It was when they got clearer. The chaos stopped being subsidized, and I had to look at what I was actually doing.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-10">What Can Parents of an Addicted Adult Child Actually Control?</h2>

          <p>
            You control four things: your money, your home, your words, and your consistency. You do not control their sobriety. That distinction sounds brutal, but it's actually where your power lives — because those four things are enough to change the entire situation.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Your resources.</strong> Decide what you will fund and what you won't. Treatment, yes. The lifestyle around active addiction, no.</li>
            <li><strong>Your home.</strong> Decide what behavior you're willing to live with under your roof, and say it out loud before the next crisis, not during it.</li>
            <li><strong>Your message.</strong> Keep it short, loving, and repeatable: "We love you. We will help you get well. We won't help you stay sick."</li>
            <li><strong>Your consistency.</strong> A boundary you enforce twice and abandon the third time teaches one lesson: wait us out.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The hard part isn't saying any of this. The hard part is staying decided when the phone rings at 2 a.m. That's why I tell parents not to set any boundary alone. Get your spouse, the siblings, a counselor — anyone who can help you hold the line you already know is right.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-10">How Do You Talk to an Adult Child About Their Addiction?</h2>

          <p>
            Calmly, specifically, and briefly. Pick a sober moment. Name what you saw — dates, events, specifics, not character judgments. Say what you're willing to do and what you're no longer willing to do. Then stop talking.
          </p>

          <p>
            What doesn't work: lectures, shame, comparisons to their siblings, and twelve-paragraph text messages sent at midnight. If lectures cured addiction, I would have gotten sober in 1995 and saved everyone a lot of trouble.
          </p>

          <p>
            What works is specificity without heat. "On Saturday you were slurring at your daughter's birthday party, and we left early" lands differently than "you're ruining this family." One is evidence. The other is an invitation to argue. People struggling with addiction will take the argument every time — it's easier than the evidence.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-10">When Is It Time to Get Professional Help?</h2>

          <p>
            It's time when the conversations go nowhere, the consequences are escalating, or your family is more organized around the addiction than your adult child is around getting well. If you've had the same talk five times with the same result, a sixth attempt isn't a plan — it's a habit.
          </p>

          <p>
            A professional intervention isn't the ambush you've seen on television. It's a structured family process: preparation, a unified message, treatment arranged in advance, and clear answers ready for every "but what about." Most of the work happens before anyone sits in a living room. And families are often shocked by how differently their adult child responds when the message is calm, unified, and backed by <Link to="/blog/what-happens-before-intervention" className="text-primary hover:text-primary/80 transition-colors">a real plan instead of raw emotion</Link>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's the part I want you to hold onto. I was somebody's adult child. My family didn't get me sober — no family can do that part. But when they stopped making it comfortable for me to stay sick, they changed the math of my addiction. Twenty-three years later, I'm still grateful they loved me enough to stop helping me the wrong way. Your love isn't wasted. It may just need a new job description.
