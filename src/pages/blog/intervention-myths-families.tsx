            question: "Do interventions actually work?",
            answer: "Yes. When conducted by a trained professional, interventions have a success rate of 80–90%. Unstructured family confrontations without professional guidance are far less effective and often counterproductive. The key is proper preparation and professional support."
          },
          {
            question: "Does someone have to want to get sober for treatment to work?",
            answer: "No. Research consistently shows that people who enter treatment under external pressure — from family, employers, or the legal system — have outcomes comparable to those who enter voluntarily. Motivation typically grows during treatment, not before it."
          },
          {
            question: "Will an intervention push my loved one further away?",
            answer: "A well-run, professionally guided intervention rarely makes things worse. Even when the person doesn't agree to treatment immediately, the conversation plants seeds that often lead to later acceptance. Continued inaction, by contrast, allows the addiction to progress."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the difference between a professional intervention and a family confrontation?",
            answer: "A professional interventionist provides structure, de-escalation, rehearsal, and a treatment plan that's ready the day of the conversation. A family confrontation without this preparation often becomes emotionally charged and unfocused, reducing the chance of a positive outcome."
          },
          {
            question: "Can an intervention happen before someone hits rock bottom?",
            answer: "Absolutely — and this is often ideal. Intervening early, before someone loses their health, relationships, or freedom, typically leads to better long-term outcomes. Families can help raise the bottom by stopping enabling behaviors and engaging a professional sooner rather than later."
          },
          {
            question: "Is an intervention only a last resort?",
            answer: "No. An intervention is a tool that can be used at any stage of a family's crisis — not just when everything has fallen apart. Earlier, more structured engagement often produces better results than waiting for catastrophe."

            Think interventions are ambushes or last resorts? Interventionist Matt Brown busts the 7 most common myths families believe — and what's actually true.
          </p>

          <p>
            I get a version of the same phone call almost every week. A mom, a spouse, a sibling — voice tight, words coming fast. They've spent the last hour Googling interventions and now they're more confused than when they started. Half the articles say confrontation is the only way. The other half say confrontation will blow everything up. Someone told them interventions don't work. Someone else said waiting is the worst thing you can do.
          </p>

          <p>Here's what I want to tell every single one of them: most of what you've heard about interventions isn't true.</p>

          <p>
            I've been doing this work for over 20 years. Before that, I was the guy who needed one. I know this world from both sides of the table, and the myths — the ones floating around in articles, movies, and well-meaning family dinners — are doing real damage. They're keeping families paralyzed when someone they love is running out of time.
          </p>

          <p>Let's clear the air.</p>

          <h2>Myth #1: An Intervention Is an Ambush</h2>

          <p>
            The idea that an intervention means surprising someone in their living room while family members take turns reading letters — that's Hollywood, not reality. A well-run intervention is a structured, carefully planned conversation. It's not a surprise attack. It's a well-prepared act of love.
          </p>

          <p>
            Modern intervention approaches — including the ARISE model I often use — are built around gradual, compassionate engagement. Sometimes the person struggling is actually part of the planning. The goal is never to corner someone; it's to create conditions where they can honestly hear what their family is experiencing and say yes to help.
          </p>

          <p>Ambushes create defensiveness. Preparation creates openings.</p>

          <h2>Myth #2: Interventions Don't Work</h2>

          <p>
            You've probably heard this one. Maybe even from a well-meaning therapist. The research tells a different story: when conducted by a trained professional, interventions have a success rate in the range of 80–90%. The keyword is <em>trained</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            What doesn't work is a disorganized family confrontation with no clear plan, no rehearsal, and no treatment bed ready. That's not an intervention — that's a fight. A professional interventionist changes the dynamic entirely. We know how to de-escalate, redirect, and stay focused on the only goal that matters: getting your person into a level of care that gives them a real shot.
          </p>

          <p>I've sat across the table from people who were furious to see me. I've watched that anger turn to tears, and then to relief. It happens more often than people think.</p>

          <h2>Myth #3: The Person Has to Hit Rock Bottom First</h2>

          <p>
            This one genuinely costs lives. The idea that someone has to lose everything before they can get better — lose their marriage, their job, their health, their freedom — is one of the most harmful myths in addiction culture.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rock bottom isn't a fixed place. It's whatever point a person becomes willing to accept help. And here's the thing most people don't know: families can raise the bottom. When the people who love someone stop absorbing the consequences of that person's using — when they get clear, get honest, and stop protecting the addiction from its natural outcomes — the{" "}

              bottom comes up to meet the person faster
            </Link>.
          </p>

          <p>You don't have to wait for a DUI, a hospitalization, or worse. In fact, the earlier a family acts with intention, the better the outcomes tend to be.</p>

          <h2>Myth #4: If They Aren't Ready, Treatment Won't Work</h2>

          <p>Motivation is not a prerequisite for recovery. This surprises a lot of people.</p>

          <p>
            Most people who go to treatment don't go because they woke up one morning feeling ready. They go because the circumstances of their life became uncomfortable enough that treatment looked better than the alternative. That's not weakness — that's actually how change works for most humans in most situations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The research on this is consistent: people who enter treatment under some form of external pressure — family, legal, employment — have outcomes comparable to people who walked in voluntarily. Motivation is something that builds inside treatment, not a ticket you need to buy before you can enter.
          </p>

          <p>Your job as a family member isn't to manufacture someone's desire to get sober. Your job is to stop making it easy to stay sick.</p>

          <h2>Myth #5: Interventions Are a Last Resort</h2>

          <p>
            I understand why families wait. Interventions feel like nuclear options — something you only pull out when everything else has failed. But by the time most families call me, they've been managing, covering, hoping, and exhausting themselves for years.
          </p>

          <p>
            An intervention is not a last resort. It's a tool. It can be used early. It can be used gently. It can be part of a broader family strategy that includes setting boundaries, getting your own support, and creating conditions for change — long before things get to a crisis point.
          </p>

          <p>
            Calling a professional isn't giving up on someone. It's deciding you're not willing to give up on them alone anymore.
          </p>

          <h2>Myth #6: The Interventionist Does All the Work</h2>

          <p>
            I wish I could tell you that hiring a professional means you can hand off the problem and wait for results. That's not how it works.
          </p>

          <p>
            My job is to prepare your family, guide the process, manage the conversation, and help navigate whatever happens in the room. But the people who matter most in that moment are the people your loved one actually loves — you. Your words carry weight that mine never will. I'm the architect and the navigator. You're the reason they might actually listen.
          </p>

          <p>
            Families who do the preparation work — who practice what they're going to say, who set real boundaries, who get their own support — get better outcomes. Every time.
          </p>

          <h2>Myth #7: If It Doesn't Work, It Made Things Worse</h2>

          <p>
            This fear keeps a lot of families from ever making the call. What if they get angry and leave? What if it pushes them further away?
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's what I've seen over 20 years: even when someone doesn't go to treatment the day of an intervention, the conversation plants something. Seeds. They heard things they'd been carefully avoiding. They saw the faces of people who love them, scared and honest and refusing to pretend anymore. That doesn't disappear.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've had people call me months later — sometimes a year later — and say that they thought about what their daughter said that day, and that they were finally ready. The intervention didn't fail. It just took time to work.
          </p>

          <p>
            A well-run intervention, even one where the person says no in the moment, almost never makes things worse. What makes things worse is continuing to do nothing.
          </p>

          <h2>You Don't Have to Figure This Out Alone</h2>

          <p>
            If you've been waiting — waiting for rock bottom, waiting until you're sure it will work, waiting until you feel ready — I want you to hear this: you already know something is wrong. You've known it for a while. The myths are just giving you permission to stay frozen.
          </p>

          <p>There is no perfect moment. There is only the decision to stop waiting and start moving.</p>

          <p>
            I became an interventionist because someone in my life cared enough to stop pretending things were fine. I know what it costs a family to make that call, and I know what it costs them not to.
