            question: "How long does it take to prepare for an intervention?",
            answer: "Most professional interventions take one to two weeks to prepare properly. This includes individual calls with family members, coaching on impact letters, treatment selection, and logistics planning. Rushing this process significantly reduces the chances of a successful outcome."
          },
          {
            question: "What happens before an intervention takes place?",
            answer: "Before an intervention, a professional interventionist typically conducts individual assessments with each family member, coaches them on writing impact letters, selects and vets treatment options, assigns roles for the intervention itself, and prepares the family for likely objections and emotional responses."
          },
          {
            question: "Can a family do an intervention without a professional?",
            answer: "Families can attempt an intervention without professional help, but the risks are significant. Without preparation, coaching, and an experienced facilitator, interventions often escalate into arguments or produce refusals. A professional helps create the conditions where saying yes becomes possible."
          },
          {
            question: "Why is treatment selection done before the intervention?",
            answer: "Treatment needs to be ready before the intervention happens because the window of willingness closes quickly. If someone agrees to get help and there's no bed available or no clear next step, that willingness often evaporates within hours. Having treatment lined up is part of what makes an intervention actionable."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the role of an interventionist during the preparation phase?",
            answer: "During preparation, the interventionist acts as a strategist, emotional coach, and logistics coordinator. They assess the family system, identify who has the most influence, coach each person on their role and their letters, vet treatment options, and prepare the group for what to expect on intervention day."
          },
          {
            question: "What makes a professional intervention different from what families try on their own?",
            answer: "Professional interventions differ primarily in structure and preparation. A professional brings outside perspective, emotional objectivity, experience with resistance and objection, existing relationships with treatment centers, and the ability to hold the process together when emotions run high."

            Before the intervention room, there's weeks of preparation most families never see. Here's what really goes into getting ready — and why it matters more than the moment itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            I got a call once from a woman — I'll call her Karen — whose son had been using heroin for six years. She'd found my number on the internet at 11:30 on a Tuesday night, and the first thing she said was: "I don't know if he'll listen to any of us. We've tried everything."
          </p>

          <p>
            I told her we weren't going to try everything. We were going to do one thing, and do it right.
          </p>

          <p>
            What happened over the next twelve days before we ever sat her son down in a room is what this article is about. Because the intervention itself — the conversation, the moment of truth — is maybe twenty percent of the work. The other eighty percent happens before the family ever assembles. And it's that eighty percent that decides whether an intervention succeeds or falls apart.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Preparation Is the Actual Intervention</h2>

          <p>
            Before an intervention happens, there's a preparation phase that often takes one to two weeks. This is where the real intervention work lives — long before anyone sits in a circle.
          </p>

          <p>
            The common picture people have of an intervention is a surprise — family gathered, someone walks in, tears happen, person goes to treatment. What gets left out is the weeks of phone calls, strategy sessions, emotional coaching, and logistics that make that moment possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I take on a case, the first thing I do is a full family assessment. I want to know who's in this person's life. Who has influence? Who enables? Who will crack under pressure and offer a way out? Who is this person most likely to listen to, and why? I'm building a map of the system before I ever introduce a plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've walked away from interventions that weren't ready. Not because the family didn't love the person — they always do — but because the preparation wasn't there. A rushed intervention is often worse than no intervention at all.
          </p>

          <h2>What Does the Preparation Phase Actually Look Like?</h2>

          <p>
            The preparation phase typically involves individual calls with each family member, coaching sessions on what to say and how to say it, treatment selection, and logistics planning — all before the intervention day arrives.
          </p>

          <p>Here's a rough breakdown of what happens before an intervention:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Individual family calls:</strong> I speak with each person separately first. I need to hear their perspective without the group dynamic. People tell me different things one-on-one. They share the things they've been afraid to say in front of each other.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact letter coaching:</strong> Each person writes a letter to their loved one. These aren't "you've hurt me so much" letters — they're structured, specific, and loving. Getting them right takes multiple drafts. I coach each person through it.</li>
            <li><strong>Role assignment:</strong> We talk through who will speak first, who will speak last, who might struggle, and who needs to sit next to whom. These decisions matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Objection preparation:</strong> We anticipate every excuse, deflection, and argument the person might use. We practice responses. Not because we're trying to "win" — but so the family doesn't get knocked off balance when things get emotional.</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment selection:</strong> I'm already making calls to treatment centers before the family knows which one is right. I'm vetting options based on the person's specific situation — their substances, their history, their insurance, their personality.</li>
            <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Travel, time of day, where the intervention happens, who picks up the person. All of it matters. An intervention at 7am when someone is sober hits differently than one at 3pm when they've already been drinking.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Emotional Coaching Nobody Talks About</h2>

          <p>
            Some of the most important work before an intervention is helping family members manage their own emotions — not suppress them, but direct them. An unregulated family will derail even a well-planned intervention.
          </p>

          <p>
            I spend a lot of time on this. Families are exhausted, scared, and often furious. They've been through things most people can't imagine. And I'm asking them to sit across from someone they love and speak calmly, specifically, and without accusation.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's hard. It requires preparation that's more therapeutic than logistical.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've seen interventions fall apart not because the addicted person refused, but because a family member lost their composure at the wrong moment — said something that felt true but wasn't useful, and gave the person an exit. The goal isn't to suppress emotion. The goal is to stay in the room with it, so the person being intervened on can feel loved rather than cornered.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part of what I do in the prep phase is help families understand the difference between those two things. Feeling cornered closes people down. Feeling loved, even under pressure, opens doors.
          </p>

          <h2>Treatment Selection: More Than Just Finding a Bed</h2>

          <p>
            Choosing a treatment center before the intervention day is non-negotiable. If a person says yes and there's no bed available, the window closes fast.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is one of the most underestimated parts of the process. People think you find a place after the person agrees. You don't. By the time someone says yes to help, they need to be on a plane or in a car within hours — not days. The willingness doesn't last if there's a gap.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've spent twenty years building relationships with treatment centers across the country. When I'm in the prep phase, I'm already making calls. I'm asking about current capacity, clinical approach, what the detox protocol looks like for this specific person's substances, and whether their culture is a match.
          </p>

          <p>
            The wrong treatment center — even a good one — can set recovery back. Fit matters. I'm not just filling a bed. I'm trying to find the right environment for a specific human being at a specific moment in their life.
          </p>

          <h2>What the Family Learns in the Preparation Phase</h2>

          <p>
            One of the less visible benefits of a well-run preparation phase is what it does for the family — even before the intervention happens. Families often arrive to the preparation process carrying guilt, shame, and confusion about their own role. The prep work begins to untangle that.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the time we're ready to intervene, most families have a clearer understanding of addiction as a condition — not a moral failure. They understand why the person they love behaves the way they do. They've started to separate the person from the behavior. And they've had a chance to rehearse saying difficult things out loud, which is different from thinking them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Families don't just show up better prepared for the intervention. They show up better prepared for everything that comes after — the treatment process, the early recovery period, and the relationship rebuilding that takes years.
          </p>

          <p>That part of the work matters regardless of how the intervention goes. And it matters a lot.</p>

          <h2>The Real Work Is Before the Room</h2>

          <p>
            When people ask me what I do, I sometimes say I'm a crisis counselor for families. But that's not quite right either. A lot of what I do happens before there's a crisis in the room — I'm trying to build the conditions where a person feels enough love, and enough reality, to make a different choice.
          </p>

          <p>
            That work is quiet. It's phone calls and letters and logistics and coaching. It's helping a father figure out how to say "I love you and I'm done watching you disappear" without it coming out as blame. It's knowing which treatment center has a bed available and which one's clinical model fits this particular person's history.
          </p>

          <p>It's the work no one sees. But it's the work that matters most.</p>

          <p>
            If you're in the middle of this with your family — if you've been waiting for the right moment, or wondering whether an intervention is even the right move — I'd love to talk. Reach out at{" "}

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <h3>How long does it take to prepare for an intervention?</h3>
          <p>
            Most professional interventions take one to two weeks to prepare properly. This includes individual calls with family members, coaching on impact letters, treatment selection, and logistics planning. Rushing this process significantly reduces the chances of a successful outcome.
          </p>

          <h3>What happens before an intervention takes place?</h3>
          <p>
            Before an intervention, a professional interventionist typically conducts individual assessments with each family member, coaches them on writing impact letters, selects and vets treatment options, assigns roles for the intervention itself, and prepares the family for likely objections and emotional responses.
          </p>

          <h3>Can a family do an intervention without a professional?</h3>
          <p>
            Families can attempt an intervention without professional help, but the risks are significant. Without preparation, coaching, and an experienced facilitator, interventions often escalate into arguments or produce refusals. A professional helps create the conditions where saying yes becomes possible.
          </p>

          <h3>Why is treatment selection done before the intervention?</h3>
          <p>
            Treatment needs to be ready before the intervention happens because the window of willingness closes quickly. If someone agrees to get help and there's no bed available or no clear next step, that willingness often evaporates within hours. Having treatment lined up is part of what makes an intervention actionable.
          </p>

          <h3>What is the role of an interventionist during the preparation phase?</h3>
          <p>
            During preparation, the interventionist acts as a strategist, emotional coach, and logistics coordinator. They assess the family system, identify who has the most influence, coach each person on their role and their letters, vet treatment options, and prepare the group for what to expect on intervention day.
          </p>

          <h3>What makes a professional intervention different from what families try on their own?</h3>
          <p>
            Professional interventions differ primarily in structure and preparation. A professional brings outside perspective, emotional objectivity, experience with resistance and objection, existing relationships with treatment centers, and the ability to hold the process together when emotions run high.
